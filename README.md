# FCC-Projects
These are the projects I completed while taking FreeCodeCamp's "Responsive Web Design" certification course.
In this Responsive Web Design Certification, I have learnt the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design. Since this course is project-based, I could have a better understanding of how things operate.
