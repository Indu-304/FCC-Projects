        <header>Introduction</header>
        <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that was first released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum. It is a general-purpose language that can be used for web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and many other applications.</p>
        <p>Python is known for its simple syntax, which makes it easy to learn and read. It is also an open-source language, which means that anyone can use and modify it.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Installation">
        <header>Installation</header>
        <p>Python can be downloaded and installed from the official Python website. The website provides installers for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Once the installer is downloaded, it can be run and Python will be installed on the system.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Python_IDE">
        <header>Python IDE</header>
        <p>An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. IDEs are designed to maximize programmer productivity by providing a single environment to perform all development tasks.</p>
        <p>PyCharm is one of the most popular IDEs for Python. It is a cross-platform IDE that provides code analysis, a graphical debugger, and many other features.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
        <header>Data Types</header>
        <p>Python has several built-in data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and Boolean values.</p>
        <p>Integers are whole numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, and so on. Floating-point numbers are decimal numbers, such as 1.5, 2.3, and so on. Strings are sequences of characters, such as "Hello, World!" Boolean values are either True or False.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>Variables are used to store data in Python. A variable is created by assigning a value to a name.</p>
        <p>For example, to create a variable named "x" with the value 5, the following code can be used:</p>
        <code>x=5</code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Operators">
        <header>Operators</header>
        <p>Python supports several operators, including arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators.</p>
        <p>Arithmetic operators include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and others.</p>
        <p>Comparison operators include equal to (==), not equal to (!=), greater than (>), less than (<), and others.</p>
        <p>Logical operators include and, or, and not.</p>
        <p>Assignment operators include =, +=, -=, *=, and /=.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Control_Flow">
        <header>Control Flow</header>
        <p>Python provides several constructs for controlling the flow of a program, including if/else statements, for loops, and while loops.</p>
        <p>If/else statements are used to perform different actions based on a condition. For example, the following code will print "Hello" if x is greater than 5, and "World" otherwise:</p>
        <code>if x > 5:
    print("Hello")
else:
    print("World")</code>
        <p>For loops are used to iterate over a sequence of items. For example, the following code will print the numbers 1 through 5:</p>
        <code>for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)</code>
        <p>While loops are used to repeat a block of code while a condition is true. For example, the following code will print the numbers 1 through 5:</p>
        <code>i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1</code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
        <header>Functions</header>
        <p>Functions are used to group together a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions can be called from other parts of the program, and can also be passed arguments.</p>
        <p>For example, the following code defines a function called "add" that takes two arguments and returns their sum:</p>
        <code>def add(x, y):
    return x + y</code>
        <p>The function can then be called from other parts of the program:</p>
        <code>result = add(3, 5)
print(result) # Output: 8</code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Libraries">
        <header>Libraries</header>
        <p>Python has a large number of libraries that can be used to perform a wide range of tasks. Some of the most popular libraries include:</p>

        <p>Here are some best practices for writing Python code:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Use descriptive variable and function names that are easy to understand.</li>
          <li>Write comments to explain the purpose of your code and how it works.</li>
          <li>Follow the PEP 8 style guide, which outlines conventions for formatting Python code.</li>
          <li>Use virtual environments to manage dependencies and isolate projects.</li>
          <li>Write unit tests to ensure that your code works as expected.</li>
          <li>Use version control, such as Git, to manage changes to your code.</li>
          <li>Avoid global variables, which can make code harder to understand and maintain.</li>
          <li>Write functions that do one thing and do it well.</li>
          <li>Use list comprehensions and generator expressions to write concise and readable code.</li>
          <li>Write modular code that can be easily reused in other projects.</li>
        </ol>
